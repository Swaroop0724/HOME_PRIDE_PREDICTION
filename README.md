Data Collection: Gather historical real estate transaction data, including property features, location, and economic indicators from sources like public records, real estate websites, and APIs.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features, such as price per square foot or neighborhood popularity scores, to enhance prediction accuracy.

Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for model development and evaluation.

Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm (linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks) based on data complexity.

Model Training: Train the selected model using the training dataset, experimenting with hyperparameters for optimization.

Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using validation data and metrics. Refine the model as needed for accuracy.
